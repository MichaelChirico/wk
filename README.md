The goal of wk is to provide lightweight R and C++ infrastructure for
packages to use well-known formats (well-known binary and well-known
text) as input and/or output without requiring external software.
Well-known binary is very fast to read and write, whereas well-known
text is human-readable and human-writable. Together, these formats allow
for efficient interchange between software packages (WKB), and highly
readable tests and examples (WKT).

## Installation

You can install the released version of wk from
[CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) with:

``` r
install.packages("wk")
```

You can install the development version from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("paleolimbot/wk")
```

If you can load the package, youâ€™re good to go\!

``` r
library(wk)
```

## Basic vector classes for WKT, WKB, points, and rectangles

Use `wkt()` to mark a character vector as containing well-known text, or
`wkb()` to mark a vector as well-known binary. Use `xy()`, `xyz()`,
`xym()`, and `xyzm()` to create vectors of points, and `rct()` to create
vectors of rectangles. These classes have full
[vctrs](https://vctrs.r-lib.org) support and `plot()`/`format()` methods
to make them as frictionless as possible working in R and RStudio.

``` r
wkt("POINT (30 10)")
#> <wk_wkt[1]>
#> [1] POINT (30 10)
as_wkb(wkt("POINT (30 10)"))
#> <wk_wkb[1]>
#> [1] <POINT (30 10)>
xy(1, 2)
#> <wk_xy[1]>
#> [1] (1 2)
rct(1, 2, 3, 4)
#> <wk_rct[1]>
#> [1] [1 2 3 4]
```
